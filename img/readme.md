#New Homepage and Main solution using just html and css...

|I think I'm getting better with just my html and css skills have acquired so far even though i am a lil bit slow in learning due to limited resources but I have set up a target for myself which I believe is one of the best way of learning.|


|I knew my solution might not be the best  but basicly this project pushed me to learn more on Grid and Column. I took my time to adjust over and over again by esuring i make use of right element at the right position and i also did some guessing just to acquire the right result, in which 90/100 of my guessing has always been correct and i couldnt make my MENU the way it was on the original design simply bcos i used just HTML $ CSS only for this design but I know with a lot of practices, I will get the best out of my frontend skills by moving on to the next chapter after two or three more practices of design based on html css...|

|Feedbacks are appreciated...
Thanks|
